      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Here are some of my projects:</p>
      <div class="projects">
        <h3 class="name">Library ERP</h3>
        <p> The main idea of this project is to make a GUI and web site application which will be able to work with SQL databases, will be fully customizeble to use it for any needs.</p>
        <p><i>Note: </i>Library ERP is a project that I`m working on at the moment. <u>For now the functionality of this application is very limited, doesn't have any sort of GUI or customization</u>. Our capabilities are limited by our knowledge.</p>

        <img src="img/projects/Screenshot 2023-06-04 at 13.34.23.png" class="library-screenshot">
        <p>I'm doing this application in OOP style sticking to <i>low coupling & high cohision</i> and <i>SOLID</i> rules.</p>
        <p>The whole functionality available at the moment is represented on the diagram bellow.</p>
